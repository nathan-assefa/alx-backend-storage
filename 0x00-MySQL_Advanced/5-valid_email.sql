-- The purpose of this trigger is to ensure that the valid_email attribute is
-- +marked as 0 (invalid) when the email attribute is changed in an UPDATE operation on the users
-- +table. This might be useful for scenarios where you want to flag an email as
-- +invalid if it has been modified. The specific application and logic for this
-- +behavior would depend on the context of your database and business requirements.
